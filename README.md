👋 Hello everyone! I'm Shen Peiyi, an enthusiastic Embedded Software Engineer specializing in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) Engineering. I hold a Bachelor's degree in IoT Engineering and possess deep expertise in C programming, Linux, RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems), and STM32 microcontrollers.
💻 On GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions, showcasing my skills in embedded programming, system architecture design, and efficient development using C, Linux, and RTOS. I'm also proficient in working with STM32 and other microcontrollers.
📚 In my free time, I enjoy reading up on the latest trends in IoT and embedded technology, tinkering with hardware projects, and constantly exploring how to apply my knowledge to practical problems. I believe in the power of the open-source community and am always open to collaborating with others to push the boundaries of technology.
🌐 If you're interested in IoT, embedded systems, have a project idea you'd like to discuss, or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out. I'm excited to connect with you and learn from your experiences!
